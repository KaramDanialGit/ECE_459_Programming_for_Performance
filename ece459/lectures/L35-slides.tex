\frametitle{DevOps for P4P}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{2cm}
So far, one-off computations:
you need to answer a question, so you write code to do that.

But many systems are long-running.\\
$\Rightarrow$ Operations.
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Keep it Rolling}

\Large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Cloud computing: often long-lived systems,\\
but we didn't talk about how.\\[1em]
Today: many companies fuse\\
development (writes the software) \\
and operations (tends the software).
\end{changemargin}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Start Me Up}

\Large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Startups:\\[1em]
No money to pay for separate \\
developer and operations teams.\\[1em]
Not that many servers, \\
just a few demo systems, test systems, etc\ldots\\
but it spirals out from there. \\[1em]
You're not really going to ask Sales to manage these servers, are you? \\
So, there's DevOps. 
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{DevOps---Good Plan?}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Is DevOps a good idea? \\
Can be used for both good and evil. \\[1em]
Good:
\begin{itemize}
\item developers involved across the software lifecycle.\\
(can learn a lot doing ops\ldots )
\item developers motivated to use correct tools \& document processes.
\end{itemize}
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Configuration as Code}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{2cm}
Systems have long come with \\
complicated (``flexible'') configuration options.


Sendmail is particularly notorious, but apache and nginx aren't super
easy to configure either.

First principle: treat \emph{configuration as code}.
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Configuration as Code}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{2cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item use version control on your configuration.
\item implement code reviews on changes to the configuration.
\item test your configurations.
\item aim for a suite of modular services that integrate together smoothly.
\item refactor configuration files.
\item use continuous builds (more on that later).
\end{itemize}
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Autoconfig}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{2cm}
Excellent idea: tools for configuration. \\[1em]

Not enough to write text \\
\qquad ``How to Install AwesomeApp'' \\[1em]

e.g. use Terraform---\\
build, installation, and update automatic \& simple.\\[1em]

 Complicated means mistakes\ldots people forget steps. They are human. 
 \end{changemargin}
 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Terraform}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/terraform.png}
\end{center}

Its whole purpose is to manage your config as codes
situation where you want to run your code using a cloud provider (e.g., AWS),

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{How Did We Get Here?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Manual install
	\item Package Manager (RPM/JAR/DLL Hell)
	\item Virtual Machines
	\item Containerization
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Containers}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Security, Report to the Bridge}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/securityteam.jpg}
\end{center}

Having an always-available service accessible over the internet makes security a very big concern.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Enormous}

You can run some program with tons of security vulnerabilities offline and feel that the security problems can be managed. 

When it's online the risk is enormous. 

All kinds of vulnerabilities are a problem, but I'll call out two of them:

Code execution/injection and data leakage (information exposure). 


\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{GDPR Says What}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Audit This}

There are some companies out there that will check your code for libraries with versions having known security vulnerabilities.

Sadly, when there is an updated version of a library, there may be breaking changes in it...

Checking for vulnerabilities should be an automatic process as part of your build and release procedures. 

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Servers as Cattle, not Pets}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{2cm}
Servers means servers, or virtual machines, or containers.\\[1em]

At scale (smaller than you think):\\
use mass tools for dealing with servers, \\
rather than doing tasks manually. \\[1em]

At least: cloud-like server initialization without manual intervention;\\
must be able to spin up a server programmatically.
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Another Example}

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/Kubernetes.jpg}
\end{center}

This is used to automate deploying and scaling of applications.

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Common Infrastructure}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Use APIs to access your infrastructure. Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item storage
\item naming and discovery
\item monitoring
\end{itemize}

Avoid one-offs---use open-source tools when applicable.\\
But build your own tools if needed.
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Oh, Think Twice...}

Is this what we are best at?

Think extra carefully if you plan to do roll your own anything that is security or encryption related.

A breach of data protection regulations can get very expensive. See \url{https://www.enforcementtracker.com/}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Rule of Ten}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
eBay:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1995: perl scripts;
\item 1997: C++/Windows;
\item 2002: Java.
\end{itemize}

Each of these architectures was appropriate at the time, \\
but not as requirements changed. \\[1em]

More sophisticated successor architectures \\
would have been overkill earlier.

Hard to predict what's needed in the future.
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Naming}

\Large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Naming is one of the hard problems in computing. 

There are only two hard things in computers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item cache invalidation,
\item naming things, and
\item off by one errors.
\end{enumerate}
\end{changemargin}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Naming Suggestions}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item use canonical one-word names for servers;
\item but, use aliases to specify functions, e.g. 1) geography (nyc); 2) environment (dev/tst/stg/prod); 
3) purpose (app/sql/etc); and 4) serial number.
\end{itemize}


There's also the Java package approach of infinite dots: live.application.customer.webdomain.com or however you want to call it. 

Pick something and be consistent.
\end{changemargin}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Continuous Integration}

\Large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item pull code from version control;
\item build;
\item run tests;
\item report results.
\end{itemize}

\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Continuous Integration Social Convention}

\Large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Don't break the build (or donuts).

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Canarying}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Deploy new code incrementally in production, \\
also known as ``test in prod'':


\begin{itemize}
\item stage for deployment;
\item remove canary servers from service;
\item upgrade canary servers;
\item run automatic tests on upgraded canaries;
\item reintroduce canary servers into service;
\item see how it goes!
\end{itemize}

Of course: implement your system with rollback.
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Monitoring}
\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Things to think about:

\begin{itemize}
	\item CPU Load
	\item Memory Utilization
	\item Disk Space
	\item Disk I/O
	\item Network Traffic
	\item Clock Skew
	\item Application Response Times
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dashboard}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Multiple systems: need an overview of all the systems.\\[1em]

Summary needs to show whether anything is wrong, \\
but not an overwhelming wall of data.

\frametitle{Dashboard}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}

Don't pay someone to stare at the dashboard and\\
press the  ``Red Alert!'' button \\
if anything goes out of some preset range.

No, for that we need some automatic monitoring.
\end{changemargin}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Red Alert}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Alerts}: a human must take action now;
\item {\bf Tickets}: a human must take action soon \\ \qquad (hours or days);
\item {\bf Logging}: no need to look at this \\ \qquad except for forensic/diagnostic purposes.
\end{itemize}


Common bad situation: logs-as-tickets.

\frametitle{Action Stations! Set Condition One Throughout the Ship}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
What do you do when you hear the fire alarm?\\[1em]
%% It is very important to be judicious about the use of alerts. 

%% If your alerts are too common, they get ignored. 

%% When you hear the fire alarm in a building, chances are your thought is not ``the building is on fire; I should leave it immediately in an orderly fashion.''.

%% It's a good heuristic; you'll be correct most of the time. 

If there is an actual fire, you will not only be wrong, \\
you might also be dead.
\end{changemargin}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Not the Kittens!!!}

\large
\begin{changemargin}{1cm}
Alerts and tickets are a great way to make user pain into developer pain.

Some SUPER CRITICAL ticket OMG KITTENS ARE ENDANGERED is an excellent way to learn the lesson... 

Devs will take steps that keep these things from happening in the future.
