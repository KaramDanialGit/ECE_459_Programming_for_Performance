#CHANGES

The changes I've made for output verification in question 5 part 3 is printing only the first 100 vector values. Typically when we are verifying outputs of a program, we do not look
at every output if the output is massive; we usually detect a logical fault within the first couple test cases and debug from there. Therefore, I decided my program can decrease
the print time by simply decreasing the amount of result items printed to 100 (otherwise print the whole resul). According to the two uploaded images, the `printtime` overhead was
significantly reduced from 1.729 seconds to 1.15 milliseconds while running on eceubuntu1.
